Linear system 1D Example 1
------------------------------------------

1D

The components of coefficient matrix are specified in setrun.py,

Haven't find how to implement eig function in fortran.

Right now rp1 is specific for this coefficient matrix. 

After successful using eig function, coefficient matrix can be 
modified as you wish. 

Boundary conditions are outflow at both boundaries.

After running this code and creating plots via "make .plots", you
should be able to view the plots in _plots/_PlotIndex.html.
