This directory contains two versions of the IPython notebook
AdvectionLimiters.ipynb, submitted by two different students.  

Please open each notebook, execute all the cells, and then take a close look
at whether the method is implemented properly and whether the notebook is
nicely laid out and presents sample results in a clear manner.  

Please make a few comments in each notebook.  To do so, insert new markdown 
cells (at relevant points in the notebook and/or at the end) and start these
cells with:

    ### COMMENT:
    Your comment....

so that when the notebook is returned to its author, it's easy to spot the
comments.

You might want to look at both notebooks and revisit your own before
commenting on what works best.  

After you make comments, use nbstripout to strip all the output from the
.ipynb file.  When you do

    git diff AdvectionLimiters1.ipynb

it should only display the comments that you added. (Same for the second file.)

Then use "git add" and "git commit", followed by "git push" to push your
comments back to GitHub.

Please do this by the due date of Homework 3 and make sure your commented
files are present in the commit you submit for grading Homework 3.
